UDP Chat System
1. Project Overview: 
This project implements a multithreaded UDP chat system in C with a terminal-based client, consisting of a central server and multiple clients. It demonstrates core concepts of concurrency, synchronization, and UDP communication by allowing multiple users to join a chat, send messages, and interact in real time. Both the server and clients use multiple threads and shared data structures to manage communication safely and efficiently.
2. Short Description
Client:
・Ncurses-based UI with separate input and output windows.
・Three-thread architecture
    ・initial_thread – initial connection.
    ・sender_thread – continuously reads user input and sends to server.
    ・listener_thread – continuously receives messages from server.
・Supports connection, disconnection, reconnection after disconnection, and sending messages
・Displays messages from the Server
Server:
・Open a server port
・Maintains a linked list of connected users with parameters such as names or connection status
・Stores global and per-user message history using circular buffers.
・Three-thread architecture
    ・listener_thread – Listens for UDP packets from clients and Spawns a worker thread for each received packet.
    ・worker_thread – performs work according to packet received when spawned by listener_thread.
    ・cleanup_thread – continuously checks connection status of clients to disconnect them.
・Manages user activity and automatically disconnects inactive clients.
・Handles commands such as conn, say, sayto, disconn, mute, unmute, rename, ret-ping, and kick (admin).
