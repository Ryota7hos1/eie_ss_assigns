1. Project Overview
This project implements a multithreaded UDP chat system in C with a terminal-based client, consisting of a central server and multiple clients. It demonstrates core concepts of concurrency, synchronization, and UDP communication by allowing multiple users to join a chat, send messages, and interact in real time. Both the server and clients use multiple threads and shared data structures to manage communication safely and efficiently.

2. How to compile & run
Server:
gcc chat_server.c -o server -lpthread
./server or ./server &

Client:
open new terminal for each client
gcc chat_client.c -o client -lncurses -lpthread
./client or ./client admin
./client makes the port a random available port
./client admin makes the port 6666 the admin port

3. Features Implemented
Required Features:
Client side
・Connect with conn$ name
・Broadcast messages say$ message
・Private messages sayto$ user message
・Mute/Unmute (mute$ user or unmute$ user)
・Rename (rename$ new_name)
・Disconnect (disconn$)
・Listener + Sender threads
・Multiple clients supported simultaneously 
Server side
・UDP listener thread
・Pre-request worker threads (one per incoming request)
・Shared linked list with RW-Lock
